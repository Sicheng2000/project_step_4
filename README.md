# Project step 4: Analysis method(s)

## Preparation

1. Reflect on the research question and data preparation strategy you have developed.
2. Review your research aims and objectives to identify the analytical techniques that will be necessary to address your research question.
3. Review the differing goals and methods of analysis types ([Part IV (Chapters 8, 9, and 10)](https://qtalr.github.io/book/part_4/) and slides [Explore](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-18.html), [Predict](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-20.html#/), and [Infer](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-22.html#/)).

## Objectives

- Apply the concepts and strategies for implementing analytical techniques to your research question and data preparation strategy.
- Develop an analysis plan that outlines the analytical techniques that will be necessary to address your research question.
- Reflect on the process of identifying an analysis plan.

## Instructions

### Getting started

*Make sure that you have forked and cloned the [`project_web`](https://github.com/lin-380-s24/project_web) repository from GitHub and that your Git and GitHub configuration is set up on your computer. See [recipe](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-4.html#check-your-understanding) and slides [Scaffolding research](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-10.html#/) and [Project orientation](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-11.html#/) for guidance.*

1. Open your research project repository in RStudio.
2. Open and modify the `reports/prospectus.qmd` as necessary to complete the steps below.

*Remember to use the edit, add, commit, push workflow to update your GitHub page.*

### Brainstorming

- First, consider the research question you have developed and the literature you have reviewed. What is the nature of the problem you are addressing? Is it a gap in the literature, a new methodological approach, or a new application of existing methods? Make sure that you have a clear understanding before proceeding.
- Next, consider the goals of exploratory, predictive, and inferential analysis. Which of these goals align with your research question? What are the key differences between these goals that help you decide which to use?
- Finally, consider the methods of analysis within the analysis type you have selected. What are the key variables or features that you will employ in your analysis? What method(s) make sense given your research question, analysis type, and the variables you will use?

### Draft an analysis plan

1. Reflect on your answers to the brainstorming questions above and develop an analysis plan that outlines the analytical techniques that will be necessary to address your research question. Your plan should outline the analysis type and methods that you will use and should address the following questions:

   - What is the analysis type you will use (explore, predict, infer)?
   - What are the key variables or features that you will employ in your analysis?
   - What method(s) make sense given your research question, analysis type, and the variables you will use?

## Assessing your progress

1. Reflect on the process of identifying a analysis strategy.

Some questions to consider:

- What did you learn?
- What did you find most/ least challenging?
- What resources did you consult?
- What questions or concerns do you have at this point?
- What do you need to address in order to move forward?

1. Consider how your prospectus is shaping up.

- How have your interests evolved?
- How have your research questions and objectives evolved?
- How have these changes been influenced by the literature you have reviewed and/ or the knowledge you have gained in this course?

## Submission

1. Use the necessary Quarto features to format your document (*e.g.*, headings, lists, links, citations, *etc.*).
2. Render your project (to HTML).
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
4. Create an Issue or Discussion post in your repository to share your progress and ask questions. Tag the instructor `@francojc` in your post.
